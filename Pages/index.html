        <h2>About The Project</h2>
        <p>
            Greetings, I am Thiago Maida, also known as Teegee.
             It is my pleasure to present this portfolio showcasing my photography featuring a collection of action figures from the renowned Lord of the Rings series. 
             Each photograph has been meticulously captured using an iPhone 14 and meticulously edited by my hand using professional editing software.
              The effort invested in recreating these scenes aims to achieve the utmost realism and visual impact. I invite you to explore these images at your leisure. Thank you sincerely for your time and consideration.
        </p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
